Welcome to **Gemeoli** — a growing collection of online games for remote teams. There’s only one game for now, but more are on the way, along with updates to a more modern tech stack.

The current game is called 🔐 **The Missing Briefcase**. It's a lighthearted online escape room game simulation. Solve a short series of puzzles with a silly storyline, a timer, background music, and optional sound effects — all built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help from ChatGPT.
